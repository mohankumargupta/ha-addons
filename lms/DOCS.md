# Home Assistant Add-on: Logitech Media Server

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "Logitech Media Server" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

Navigate to the web UI via ingress or directly on port 9000 and configure.

## Add-on Configuration

The LMS server add-on can be tweaked to your liking. This section
describes each of the add-on configuration options.

### Basic

default locations
 - /config/lms

Addional software over lms.
 - osync
 - rsync
 - squeezy

Example basic config:-

```yaml
          "mounts": [],
          "dirs": [],
          "links": [],
          "init_commands": [],
          "packages": []
```

### NAS

NAS mounting in the addon via the settings. So for nfs and cifs example:-

```
mounts:
  - 'thepi4.lan:/srv/store/music/ /data/mnt/nfs'
  - '-t cifs -o user=ha,pass=xxxx //testpi.lan/share /data/mnt/cifs'
  - '--bind /media/music /data/mnt/music'
dirs:
 - /data/mnt/cifs
 - /data/mnt/nfs

links:
  - dest: /data/mnt/music/collection
    link: /var/music
  - link: /srv/storage/incomming/new-music
    dest: /data/mnt/music/new-music
  - link: /srv/storage/music/playlists
    dest: /data/mnt/music/playlists
```
This is all to make sure the mount point exists in an unbacked-up area and the mount options. The  use of links to give more friendly paths,
So in my setup I have mounted media in the underlying OS and then substituted a bind mount for the raw nfs and also used links to make it look like my previous Linux install remain the same so all the paths for trackstat remain the same as I migrated that database.
